                        <p>Cyberextortion is a crime involving an attack or threat of an attack coupled with a demand for money or some other response in return for stopping or remediating the attack.</p>
            <p>Ransomware attacks, in which blackmailers encrypt victim systems and offer to decrypt the systems after the victim sends funds, usually in the form of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, are currently among the most common form of cyberextortion. However, other types of cyber blackmail can include <a href="https://technologyborg.wordpress.com/distributed-denial-of-service-ddos-attack/">distributed denial-of-service</a> (DDoS) attacks that the blackmailers offer to suspend on receipt of payment or the threat of exposing confidential corporate data that has been stolen from an organization.</p>
            <p>Cyberextortion attacks start with a hacker gaining access to an organization&#8217;s systems and seeking points of weakness or targets of value. While <a href="https://technologyborg.wordpress.com/ransomware/">ransomware</a> attacks can be automated through malware spread by email, infected websites or ad networks, these attacks tend to spread indiscriminately, and they may result in only a small percentage of victims paying the extortionists. More targeted attacks can produce less collateral damage while providing more lucrative targets for the extortion attempt.</p>

            <h3 class="section-title">Types of cyberextortion</h3>
            <p>Today, businesses are being hit by different types of cyberextortion, including:</p>
            <ul class="default-list">
            <li>Cyber blackmail occurs when cybercriminals breach corporate networks to discover and exfiltrate valuable data. For example, in 2017, hackers shared unreleased episodes of the Netflix series <em>Orange Is the New Black</em> when the streaming company did not pay the blackmailers. That same year, another cyberextortionist threatened to release unaired episodes of <em>Game of Thrones</em> if HBO did not pay $5.5 million in bitcoin.</li>
            <li>Attackers may conduct <a href="https://technologyborg.wordpress.com/denial-of-service-attack/">denial-of-service</a> (DoS) and DDoS attacks against a targeted company and solicit payment to stop the attack. In some cases, the attacker may threaten a DDoS attack and demand a payment to not carry it out.</li>
            <li>In ransomware scams, victim devices are infected with malware that prevents authorized users from accessing the device or the data stored on it. To regain access to the device or data, the victim has to pay the hacker a ransom. A user can inadvertently download the malware by opening an infected email attachment, visiting a compromised website or clicking on a pop-up ad.</li>
            <li>Database ransom attacks are carried out by hackers who identify and hijack databases that use versions of MySQL, Hadoop, MongoDB, Elasticsearch and other systems that have not been fully patched or that have not reset default administrative passwords. Attackers have been observed replacing the contents of a breached server with a ransom note requesting a specific amount of bitcoin to reinstate the data.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As long as there are undesired outcomes related to computers and data, there will likely be cyberextortionists who devise new scams to exploit the individuals or organizations who want to prevent those negative outcomes.</p>

            <h3 class="section-title">Effects of cyberextortion</h3>
            <p>The cyber economy research firm Cybersecurity Ventures predicted that the annual global cost of damage from ransomware would be greater than $11.5 billion by 2019, up from $325 million in 2015. In its &#8220;2017 Annual Cybersecurity Report,&#8221; Cisco reported that ransomware is growing at an annual rate of 350%. While Cybersecurity Ventures estimated that ransomware damages would exceed $5 billion in 2017, that is still just a fraction of the nearly $600 billion cost of cybercrime in 2017 estimated by McAfee.</p>
            <p>Companies victimized by cyberextortion schemes not only suffer from breaches or loss of sensitive corporate data, they may also sustain serious damage to their reputations, lose customers and, consequently, lose money.</p>
            <p>If customers can&#8217;t access their preferred websites, they&#8217;ll likely move on to other companies that offer the same or similar products or services. In addition, hackers will use the threat of selling a victim&#8217;s corporate secrets to rival companies &#8212; often a great motivation for a victim company to pay a blackmail ransom.</p>
