                        <h4>WHAT IS DARK NET ?</h4>
            <blockquote><p>Darknet is an overlay network that can only be accessed using specific software,configurations,or authorization.</p>
            <p>It is part of the Deep Web, because its contents are not accessible through search engines.</p>
            <p>But it is something more, it is anonymous.</p>
            <p>It hosts anonymous websites.</p>
            <p><span style="color:var(--color-neutral-50);">Yeah, you wouldn&#8217;t know who the owner is unless he explicitly reveal his information.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color:var(--color-neutral-50);">It offers full anonymity to users too.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color:var(--color-text);background-color:#ffffff;">Darknet anonymity is usually achieved using an &#8216;onion network&#8217;.</span></p>
            <p><span style="background-color:#ffffff;color:var(--color-text);">I am sure you have cut an onion once in your lifetime and you had been crazy about the number of layers it has, same happens when use an onion network.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color:var(--color-neutral-50);">There are numbers of encryption layers that hide your true identity.</span></p></blockquote>
            <h4>USES OF DARKNET:</h4>
            <blockquote><p>Ok, so you have grasped what Darknet is, Now you may ask me why should you use it.</p>
            <p><span style="background-color:#ffffff;color:var(--color-text);">Well the reason could be any of them:</span></p>
            <p>To better protect the privacy right of citizens from targeted and mass surveillance.</p>
            <p><span style="background-color:#ffffff;color:var(--color-text);">Whistleblowing and news leaks</span></p>
            <p><span style="color:var(--color-neutral-50);">Hacking and Computer Crime. Maybe,you may want to chat with the most dangerous of hackers.</span></p>
            <p><span style="background-color:#ffffff;color:var(--color-neutral-50);">Sale of restricted goods.</span></p>
            <p><span style="background-color:#ffffff;color:var(--color-neutral-50);">File sharing.</span></p></blockquote>
            <h4>CAN WE ACCESS DARKNET ?</h4>
            <blockquote><p>Well the most popular way to access Darknet is by using TOR browser.</p>
            <p><span style="background-color:#ffffff;color:var(--color-text);">Techically, it stands for &#8216;The Onion Router&#8217; and it is as simple as installing a new browser.</span></p>
            <p>After that you would need a URL or directory that contains URLs to different websites or class of websites so that you know what to type in into the brower&#8217;s address bar.</p>
            <p><span style="background-color:#ffffff;color:var(--color-text);">You can easily get URLs in Onion Directory of Darknet or just google for DarknetSites.</span></p>
            <p><span style="background-color:#ffffff;color:var(--color-text);">Make sure you use TOR browser.</span></p>

            <h4>EVERYTHING ABOUT TOR: WHAT IS TOR? HOW TOR WORKS</h4>
            <blockquote><p>Tor or The Onion Router, allows anonymous use of internet veiling the actual identity of the user.</p>
            <p><span style="background-color:#ffffff;color:var(--color-text);">It protects the user from any traffic analysis and network spying.</span></p>
            <p><span style="background-color:#ffffff;color:var(--color-text);">Tor is perhaps the most popular and secure option available for anonymous internet connectivity.</span></p>
            <p><span style="background-color:#ffffff;color:var(--color-text);">Tor is based on the principle of &#8216;onion routing&#8217; which was developed by Pual Syverson, Michael G. Reed and David Goldschlag at the United States Naval Research Laboratory in the 1990&#8217;s.</span></p>
            <p><span style="background-color:#ffffff;color:var(--color-text);">The alpha version of Tor named &#8216;The Onion Routing Project&#8217; or simply TOR Project was developed by Roger Dingledine and Nick Mathewson, launched on September 20,2002. Further development was carried under the financial roof of Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).</span></p>
            <p><span style="background-color:#ffffff;color:var(--color-text);">The Tor Project Inc. is a non-profit organisation that currently maintains Tor and is responsible for its development. It is mainly funded by the United States Government, further aid is provided by Swedish Government and different NGOs and individual sponsors.</span></p></blockquote>

            <p>Please don&#8217;t try this tweak with your root drive (usually C: is the root drive) since root drives are not intended to be locked because they are mandatory for the system and application programs.</p>
            <p>*Start &amp; Run and type Regedit to open Registry editor</p>
            <p>*Browse HKEY_CURRENT_USER SoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionPoliciesExplorer</p>
            <p>*Create a new DWORD value NoViewOnDrive and set its value as</p>
            <p>2^ (Alpha Number of Drive Letter-1) where Alpha number are simple counting of alphabets from A to Z as 1-26</p>
            <p>For example: to lock C:, Alpha number of C is 3 so 2^(3-1) = 4 (decimal value)</p>
            <p>*To lock more drives,calculate the value of each drive and then set sum of those numbers as value</p>
            <p>*To unlock your drive just delete the key from the registry.</p></blockquote>

            <blockquote><p>A quick search on Google Play throws up several webcam applications. We tried 5 of the top 10 results, but most didn&#8217;t work properly. From the ones that didn&#8217;t crash repeatedly, SmartCam failed to show the video, and DroidCam needs you to install an app on Windows to work.</p>
            <p>IP Webcam is easily the best of the lot because it works through your browser, which gives it the cross-platform compatibility.</p>
            <p>To set up a security camera on Android, follow these steps.</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Connect your computer and the phone to the same Wi-Fi network.</li>
            <li>Install the IP Webcam app on your smartphone.</li>
            <li>Close all other camera apps. Force close them from the app switcher before you proceed.</li>
            <li>Launch the IP Webcam app. Scroll to the bottom and tap Start server.</li>
            <li>The app will now fire up your phone&#8217;s camera and display a URL. our URL was <a href="http://172.32.15.110:8080" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://172.32.15.110:8080</a>.</li>
            <li>Enter this URL in any browser on your computer and hit Enter.</li>
            <li>In the browser, you&#8217;ll see a drop down menu next to Video renderer. Select Browser.</li>
            <li>Below that, you&#8217;ll see Audio renderer. Select HTML wav.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Now you&#8217;ll see a live video feed in your browser. You can also record this footage via the browser. To do this, just press the red Record button under the video. This saves the footage as an MP4. There in the browser. You can select the Flash option (doesn&#8217;t work on all computers) or open the same URL in VLC Media Player.</p>
            <p>9. To do this, first download and install VLC from this website. Then in VLC, go to Media &gt; Network Stream and enter the URL from the app as seen in step 5.</p>
            <p>Once the app is running, you don&#8217;t need to keep your phone&#8217;s screen on. It works even when the phone is locked, but the video feed is slightly smoother when the screen is on.</p></blockquote>

            <h4>THE MOST SECURE WAY TO ENCRYPT AND HIDE YOUR FILES</h4>
            <blockquote><p>Here, I am going to show you how to hide, encrypt and secure your data everywhere you go. We will be using a free and open source tool called Truecrypt.</p>
            <p>Truecrypt is an incredible software which does an extremely good job of encrypting your data. Truecrypt encryption is thought to be unbreakable, even the FBI hackers can&#8217;t break it. There are many ways to configure truecrypt, but here I will be discussing the simplest and most convenient way.How to use truecrypt to encrypt your files and folders? We will create a &#8220;file container&#8221; much like a secure vault. You can decide the size of this &#8216;vault&#8217;. This vault is a single file and can have any extension and you can transfer it anywhere you like. You can open the vault by opening it with truecrypt and entering the password. So, lets get started</p>
            <p>1.Open truecrypt and click on Create Volume</p>
            <p>2.Leave the default and Click next</p>
            <p>3.Leave the default and click Next</p>
            <p>4.Click Select File</p>
            <p>5. Anywhere in your hand drive, just type any file name you want your container to be. Here its myfile.txt Note that .txt is just an extension, and it doesn&#8217;t have any meaning in this regard. The idea is that people will think its a mere txt file.</p>
            <p>6. Leave the default and Click next</p>
            <p>7. Enter the desired size of the container and click next. I&#8217;ve made mine 3GB. Note that you cannot change the size of the container afterwards.</p>
            <p>8. Create a strong password for your container. Note that the only way to crack truecrypt is to brute-force it. So, if your password is at least 15 or 20 characters with all the special characters etc, it should theoretically be impossible to break.</p>
            <p>9. Move your mouse around a bit, and click Format. It may take some time depending on your CPU power. After the format is complete, close the window.</p>
            <p>10. Next, click on any drive in the list.I&#8217;ve clicked drive L: After that, select the file we created earlier, myfile.txt And finally click on Mount.</p>
            <p>11. Once you press mount, it will ask for the password you set earlier. Click Ok and you are done.</p></blockquote>
